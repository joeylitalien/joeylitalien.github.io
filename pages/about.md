I earned my Ph.D. from [McGill University][mcgill] in 2024, where I was part of the [McGill Graphics Lab (MGL)][mgl]. I got my B.Sc. from the same university in [Honours Mathematics and Computer Science][math-cs] in 2015 and my M.Eng. in Graphics in 2018. I speak both French (native) and English.

Outside of research, I appreciate aesthetics, minimalism, and design of all kinds. Music-wise, I enjoy house and techno, and sometimes [I record mixes](https://soundcloud.com/joeylitalien) and [spin some records](https://www.discogs.com/user/milpotent/collection). I was a [soccer referee](https://www.soccerquebec.org/fr/index.html) for more than ten years. Above all, I love problem solving and discovering new algorithms related to rendering, both physics-based and real-time.

If you would like to reach me, shoot me an <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email.</a>

For the typography enthusiasts, font is [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts) on macOS, [Segoe UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/segoe-ui) on Windows and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) on Linux. Icons are from [Tabler](https://tabler-icons.io/). This website was entirely coded with [Jekyll][jekyll]. Styling is my own take on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) Jekyll theme. Also note that despite my last name, I am _not_ Italian (but I do like pasta).
